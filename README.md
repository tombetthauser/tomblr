# tomblr

A full-stack portfolio project focused on building a set of features such as user authentication loosely based on the UI, structure and functionality of tumblr, a platform designed to help bots and confused teenagers create a rich ecosystem of confusing content and interactions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### key features

These will be the basic features that the initial version of tomblr will include.

```
• **user authentication**
• basic **crud** functionality for individual blog pages
• basic **crud** functionality for individual image / text posts
• a main **timeline / feed** where user posts are displayed chronologically
```

### extra features

Dream features that might be too time-consuming or complex to realistically employ in the near term.

```
• custom CNAME / **DNS rerouting** allowing users to use custom domain names
• a filterable **open api** for the main feed and / or individual blogs
• limited **custom html** editing for user blog pages
```
