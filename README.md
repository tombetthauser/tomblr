Since posts can be a multitude of content types, conditionals had to be included within each post to ensure that the correct formatting would occur, utlimately resulting in a seamless experience for the end-user.
```
return (
  <div key={post.id} className="post-container">
    <img className="avatar" src={avatar}></img>
    <div className="postbox">
      <div className ="post-top">{topBar}</div>
      {titleGoesHere}
      {imagesGoesHere}
      {audioGoesHere}
      {videoGoesHere}
      {textGoesHere}
      {tagsGoesHere}
      <div className ="post-bottom">{botBar}</div>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```
Content types not associated with a post are not rendered whereas proper content is then formatted and inserted into a post-block.


Methods to create posts including animations were added to facilitate user experience
